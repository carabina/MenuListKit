MenuListKit provides a fast way to create lists and menus with declerative programming in Swift. This project leverage on [IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit).

📁 | Less code and less files to manage |
🔋 | Efficient cell updates thanks to `ListDiffable` by [IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit) |

⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️

***

The idea of MenuListKit is to provide a declerative way to create menus in iOS. [...]

In the example below there's a classic and simple **ToDo List** app; as you can see the array of models reflects the cells in the `UICollectionView`.
